    "1. A list is mutable, meaning you can change its contents while tuples are not, meaning once the values are entered and saved, they cannot be changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Ex: A list is good for saving employee details like his address, phone number, etc. since they can be changed anytime when an employee wants to make a change. His name, blood group and eye color however can be saved in a tuples since they cannot be changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The other main difference is that a tuple is hashable, meaning that you can use it as a key to a dictionary, among other things but a list cannot do so. "
